Working on [Project Thoth](https://thoth-station.ninja/) to give the world a very well educated dependency management, getting Cyborgs to a point where they are recognized as valuable team members (hey managers, how do you compare the performance of a human to the one of a bot? how is getting the bonus?). Working at the AICoE of [Red Hat](https://next.redhat.com/), working to create AI that helps developers!
